LEMBRA DE APAGAR O REPOSITORIO DO GIT PARA NAO VAZAR AS ARTES DO DRIZZLE


Main Idea: The game consists in a player that moves in a platform like style,
the main character wants to pass trhough some physical test's for applying for a job
but for that it needs to stay healthy all the time until get in the job. There will
be 3 tests, so 3 stages to pass, in the stages you need to avoid collecting unhealthy
food. The LESS unhealthy food you get, MORE healthy you become.

Mechanics:
    - collect food and count it
	- trigger end of stage and calculate health
	- moving platforms
	- moving food (x and y axis, circle shape)
	- knockback
	- static enemies throwing food
	- food cannons

Technical Needs:
    - on screen detection
	- enemy spawn
	- enemy range attack
	- checkpoints
	- death holes
	- player range attack

	maybe-
	- serveral food collected in a row kills
	- collecting gives you a little boost

Overall:
    - 3 stages
	- 3-4 enemies per stage
	- 2-3 scenario obstacles
	- (MAYBE) a final boss

Art:
   - All characters are animals
   - 16x16 base
   - 4-5 food sprites per stage
   - main caracter is a fox
   - music probably classical chiptune remix made by me
